# Scripts

A collection of my bash and python scripts.  
Work in progress; I'm planning to add more scripts as I think of tasks to simplify!

## Usage

If you try using any of these, remember to give execute permissions to the script.

    $ chmod +x script_name

This will allow you to run the scripts as shown:

    $ ./script_name

If scripts are added to `$PATH`, they can be exeuted from any working directory:

    $ google "youtube the best of the beatles"

Please refer to the individual scripts for detailed usage information.
