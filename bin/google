Quick Google search from the command line.

### Usage

```
$ ./google "youtube the lumineers"
```

Note: The script also works for most terms without being wrapped in quotes.
But it's safer to provide the quotes around your search term in case you have
special characters like ' (apostrophe), which serve a different purpose in
the command line.
