# Dotfiles

My custom configuration files:

-   `scripts/`: [python/bash scripts](https://github.com/rajitbanerjee/scripts)
-   `shell/`: common configs for all types of shells
-   `bash/`, `bashrc`: bash configurations
-   `vim/`, `vimrc`: vim configurations
-   `gitconfig`: username, email
-   `vscode.txt`, `vscode-server.txt`: list of VSCode extensions
-   `jupyter-lab.txt`: jupyter lab setup info
-   `./install`: prepare dotfiles with dotbot, set up Vundle

Installation on new systems, and symlinking with `$HOME` (for existing systems) managed by the excellent [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).
